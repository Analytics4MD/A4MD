This project is based on signac-flow.

So the dependencies are signac and signac-flow packages. Ask Stephen Thomas (stephenthomas2018@gmail.com) if you are not sure.

Once these are set up, set the parameters in init.py and run

```
python init.py
```

This will set up the workspace. Now to run the simulations:

```
python a4md.py submit
```
